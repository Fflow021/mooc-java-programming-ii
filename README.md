# Java Programming Part II

Here you can see all my codes and solutions to the [mooc.fi's Java Programming Part II](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-8).

You can check my notes [here](https://fflow021.notion.site/Java-Programming-Part-2-060c1b9de7cc4c208654f306d3914e31?pvs=4).

I only made it up to part 12, as my goals are to learn Java and move on to learn Spring boot, so I pulled my certificate and left the rest of the course which is about JavaFX aside.
